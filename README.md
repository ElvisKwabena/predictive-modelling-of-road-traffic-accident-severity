# Road Traffic Accident Severity Prediction  
**Undergraduate Thesis – Dataset & Code**

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **dataset and source code** used for my undergraduate thesis titled:

**“Predictive Modelling of Road Traffic Accident Severity: Combining Statistical and Machine Learning Approaches.”**

The study focuses on building and evaluating predictive models to classify road traffic accident severity levels (Low, Moderate, High) using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. The aim is to support data-driven road safety analysis and decision-making.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Explore and preprocess road traffic accident data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns  
- Develop and compare statistical and machine learning models  
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics  
- Identify important factors influencing accident severity

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)  

Techniques such as **feature engineering**, **class imbalance handling (SMOTE)**, and **hyperparameter tuning** were applied to improve predictive performance.
